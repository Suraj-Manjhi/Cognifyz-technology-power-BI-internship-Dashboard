# üìä Power BI Investment Analysis Project

This repository contains the Power BI project I completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The project focuses on analyzing investment patterns using various parameters such as gender, investment duration, and sources of information. Through a series of tasks, I explored the data, derived insights, and created a comprehensive dashboard to visualize these findings.
